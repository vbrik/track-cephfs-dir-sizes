# trackdir — track CephFS directory sizes over time

trackdir records how the sizes of directories on a CephFS filesystem change
over time. It reads CephFS recursive statistics (`ceph.dir.rbytes`,
`rfiles`, `rsubdirs`, `rctime`), so the size of a whole subtree costs one
metadata request instead of a full scan.

Status: `trackdir capture` works. Periodic sampling into PostgreSQL
(`trackdir sample`) is planned.

## Requirements

- Linux with the CephFS kernel client.
- openat2 (Linux 5.6+); required when running as root.
- Python 3.12 or newer; no other dependencies.
- Recommended: the `dirstat` mount option. It cuts the metadata requests
  per directory from four to one; trackdir warns when it is missing.

## Install

    pip install .

Or run from a checkout without installing: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m trackdir`.

## Capture directory state

    trackdir capture /mnt/cephfs/projects --max-depth 3 -o projects.jsonl.gz

`capture` records every directory under ROOT down to `--max-depth` into one
file, for offline debugging, development and tests. It is read-only on ROOT
and writes only the output file, which appears only if the capture succeeds
and is never overwritten. Run it as root for a complete capture: as another
user, unreadable directories are recorded as EACCES errors.

`--max-dirs` (default 1,000,000) stops the run before memory runs out;
`--jobs` (default 16) sets how many directories are probed concurrently.

To share a capture, anonymize it with a secret key kept out of the
repository. Captures taken with the same key line up. trackdir refuses a key
that group or others can read:

    (umask 077; head -c 32 /dev/urandom > trackdir.key)
    trackdir capture /mnt/cephfs/projects --max-depth 3 \
        --anonymize trackdir.key -o projects-anon.jsonl.gz

### Capture file format

A gzipped JSON Lines file. Line 1 is a header (`format`, `version`, `root`,
`max_depth`, `rstat_mode`, timestamps, counts, `anonymized`, …). Every other
line is one directory, in tree order:

    {"path":"proj/2019","ino":1099511628279,"mode":16877,"uid":0,"gid":0,"nlink":5,"rctime":1792088576117716441,"rbytes":172057275971107,"rfiles":1234,"rsubdirs":4}
    {"path":"secret","ino":1099511627777,"mode":16872,"uid":0,"gid":0,"nlink":6,"error":{"stage":"open","code":"EACCES"}}

`path` is relative to ROOT (`.` is ROOT itself); `rctime` is in
nanoseconds; fields that could not be read are omitted. Inspect a capture
with `zcat FILE | jq`.

## Development

    pytest
    ruff format . && ruff check .

Tests need neither Ceph nor root; real data comes from anonymized captures
in `tests/data/`.
